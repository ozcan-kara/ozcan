As an **Individual Contributor (L4)**, I focus on **backend development and cloud engineering**, with a strong interest in **high-concurrency, real-time platforms** and **event-driven distributed systems**.

My core technical focus is on building systems that require **exactly-once processing guarantees**, ensuring **consistent balance updates without data loss or duplication**, and designing **reliable, fault-tolerant architectures** that scale efficiently under heavy load.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

I design and develop **microservice-based applications** using **Go** and **Java**, with a strong emphasis on **concurrency, parallelism, and performance optimization**.

On the platform side, I build and operate distributed infrastructures using **Kubernetes**, **Amazon EKS**, and modern container technologies, focusing on **scalability, resilience, and cost efficiency**.

I have hands-on experience across **multi-cloud environments**, including **AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**, **Huawei Cloud**, and **Alibaba Cloud**, and continuously strengthen my expertise through **international certifications** and real-world production systems.
